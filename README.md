# Goal

This project implements a binary classification model using Logistic Regression to distinguish between rocks and mines based on sonar readings. The model is trained on the "Sonar Dataset," which contains frequency-based sonar signals reflected from objects in the water.

Dataset Information

File Name: sonar dataset.csv

Format: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

Number of Samples: 208

Number of Features: 60

Target Variable: Binary classification (R for Rock, M for Mine)

Each row in the dataset represents a sample with 60 numeric attributes (representing sonar signal frequencies) and a target label (R or M).

Applications: 

This dataset is commonly used for:

Machine Learning model training (e.g., classification algorithms like SVM, Decision Trees, Neural Networks)

Feature selection and data preprocessing experiments

Signal processing and sonar-based object detection research
