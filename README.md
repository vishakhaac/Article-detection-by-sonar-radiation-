# Goal
This project implements a binary classification model using Logistic Regression to distinguish between rocks and mines based on sonar readings. The model is trained on the "Sonar Dataset," which contains frequency-based sonar signals reflected from objects in the water.

# Dataset 
The data is in the form of a CSV file.

# DESCRIPTION

With an input of sonar signal data, the implementation applies machine learning algorithms to classify the signals.
The model is trained using supervised learning techniques to distinguish between rocks and mines effectively.
 
Number of Samples: 208

Number of Features: 60

Target Variable: Binary classification (R for Rock, M for Mine)
# WHAT I HAD DONE

The step-by-step procedure of how the project works:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the dataset from a CSV file.

Handle missing values and normalize numerical features.


Applications: 

This dataset is commonly used for:

Machine Learning model training (e.g., classification algorithms like SVM, Decision Trees, Neural Networks)

Feature selection and data preprocessing experiments

Signal processing and sonar-based object detection research
